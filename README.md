# listtr
*Manage your RSVPs with listtr* <br/>
A fullstack web application, utilising Node.js as the server, and React.js for frontend

Background
----------
Why listtr? <br/>
We realise that flipping through pages of RSVPs can be a tedious process for hosts. This is where the idea of listtr came about. We hope to bring ease to the process of registration in events by sending invitation through email and do live registrations.

How to install
-------------
Open your terminal and type the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jmhs/listtr.git
    $ cd listtr
    $ cd backend
    $ npm install
    $ cd ..
    $ cd frontend
    $ yarn install

To run the web application, you will need to setup:

 1. Cloudinary account - for image upload
 2. Sendgrid - to send email invitation
